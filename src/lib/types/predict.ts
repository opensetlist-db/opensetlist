/**
 * Types for the Predicted Setlist song-picker UI introduced after PR
 * #397's "copy from past show" trigger. The picker replaces the inline
 * `<SongSearch>` autocomplete in `<PredictedSetlist>` with a catalog-
 * driven multi-select shell (mobile bottom sheet via vaul / desktop
 * inline side panel).
 *
 * Server-side shape (`AvailableSong[]`) is built from the event's
 * primary artist + its sub-units; the picker filters this list
 * client-side by search + unit chip. `UnitFilter[]` is also server-
 * derived so the chip set adapts to whichever artist the event
 * belongs to (Hasunosora today; any future artist later).
 *
 * Mockup of record:
 *   `F:\work\vaults\opensetlist\raw\mockups\event-page-mobile-predict-mockup.jsx`
 *   `F:\work\vaults\opensetlist\raw\mockups\event-page-desktop-v2-mockup.jsx`
 * Task spec:
 *   `F:\work\vaults\opensetlist\raw\task-song-picker-predict-mode.md`
